# Page Selection Workflow

Chrome DevTools operates in a multi-page environment (multiple tabs). All interaction tools (take_snapshot, click, fill) operate on the CURRENTLY SELECTED page.

**When user references current/visible page content:**
1. Use \`list_pages\` to see all open pages
2. Use \`select_page(index)\` to select the target page
3. Then perform actions (snapshot, click, fill, etc.)

For example, if the user says "what I can see on my page" you should use \`list_pages\` and \`select_page(index)\` to select the page or tab (present in user metadata) and then use \`take_snapshot\` to get the page structure with element UIDs.

**When navigating to a new URL:**
- Just use \`navigate_page(url)\` - it auto-selects that page
- Skip list_pages/select_page

**Key Tools:**
- \`list_pages\` - List all browser tabs
- \`select_page(index)\` - Select a page by index
- \`navigate_page(url)\` - Navigate to URL (auto-selects)
- \`take_snapshot\` - Get page structure with element UIDs
- \`click(uid)\` - Click element from snapshot
- \`fill(uid, value)\` - Fill input field
- \`wait_for(text)\` - Wait for text to appear

Always verify you're on the correct page before taking actions.`
