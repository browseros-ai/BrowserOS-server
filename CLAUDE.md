# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Coding guidelines
- Write minimal code comments. Only add comments for non-obvious logic, complex algorithms, or critical warnings. Skip comments for self-explanatory code, obvious function names, and simple operations.

## Project Overview

**BrowserOS MCP Server** - A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes Chromium capabilities to AI Agent and MCP clients. We have a fork of chromium called BrowserOS.

## Bun Preferences

Default to using Bun instead of Node.js:

- Use `bun <file>` instead of `node <file>`
- Use `bun test` instead of `jest` or `vitest`
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install`
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>`
- Bun automatically loads .env (no dotenv needed)
